# 2026-Projects
AI & DevOps Projects – 2026

This repository contains AI and DevOps projects developed during 2026 and beyond.
Each project is based on real-world use cases and focuses on automation, cloud infrastructure, and modern DevOps practices.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical, job-ready skills rather than theoretical knowledge, making it suitable for technical interviews and recruiter reviews.

This repository is actively maintained, and many more projects will be added over time as I continue learning, experimenting, and building real-world solutions in AI and DevOps.

* DevOps & Cloud (AWS)
* CI/CD & Automation
* Containers & Kubernetes
* Infrastructure as Code
* Python Automation & Scripting
* Agentic AI & AI/ML Integrations
